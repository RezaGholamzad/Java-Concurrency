    Itâ€™s not necessary that each Runnable should be executed in a separate thread.
    Sometimes, we need to do multiple jobs in a single thread and each job is instance
    of Runnable. To design this type of solution, a multi runnable should be used.
    This multi runnable is nothing but a collection of runnables which needs to be
    executed. Only addition is that this multi runnable is also a Runnable itself.
