CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a 
set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

#What is CountDownLatch?

This class enables a java thread to wait until other set of threads completes their tasks. 
e.g. Applicationâ€™s main thread want to wait, till other service threads which are responsible 
for starting framework services have completed started all services.

CountDownLatch works by having a counter initialized with number of threads, which is 
decremented each time a thread complete its execution. When count reaches to zero, 
it means all threads have completed their execution, and thread waiting on latch 
resume the execution.

#possible usages in real time applications: 

1) Achieving Maximum Parallelism : Sometimes we want to start a number of threads at the same time 
to achieve maximum parallelism. For example, we want to test a class for being singleton. 
This can be done easily if we create a CountDownLatch with initial count 1, and make wait 
all threads to wait of latch. A single call to countDown() method will resume execution 
for all waiting threads in same time.

2) Wait N threads to completes before start execution: For example an application start-up 
class want to ensure that all N external systems are Up and running before handling 
the user requests.

3) Deadlock detection: A very handy use case in which you can use N threads to access a 
shared resource with different number of threads in each test phase, and try to create 
a deadlock.
